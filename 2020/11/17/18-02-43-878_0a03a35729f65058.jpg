<p>Matt Taibbi, November 5, 2020</p>
<blockquote><p>Defying years of muddle-headed media analyses, Trump underperformed with white men, but made gains with every other demographic. Some 26 percent of his votes came from nonwhite Americans, the highest percentage for a Republican <a title="" href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/04/despite-racist-charges-trump-did-better-with-minorities-than-any-gop-candidate-in-60-years/" data-cke-saved-href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/04/despite-racist-charges-trump-did-better-with-minorities-than-any-gop-candidate-in-60-years/" data-original-title="">since 1960</a>. The politician who became instantly famous — and infamous — by saying of Mexican immigrants, “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists,” performed stunningly well with Latino voters.</p>
<p><span id="more-15225"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more amazing was Trump’s performance among Black voters. The man whose 2016 message to “the blacks” was very nearly a parody of long-ago New York mayoral candidate Mario Procaccino’s pledge that “<a title="" href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1995/12/21/027596.html?pageNumber=49" data-cke-saved-href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1995/12/21/027596.html?pageNumber=49" data-original-title="">My heart is as black as yours</a>” must have found a new way to connect. Trump doubled his support with Black women, moving from 4% in 2016 to 8%, while upping his support among Black men from 13% to 18%. Remember, this was after four years of near-constant denunciations of Trump as not just a racist, but the leader of a literal white supremacist movement….</p>
<p>Trump’s numbers with the LGBTQ community were a stunner also, jumping from 14% to 28%. In September, a dating app for queer men called Hornet ran a survey that showed 45% support for Trump among gay men.</p>
<p>Trump lost the election because of his handling of the pandemic, the top issue for 41% of voters, who chose Biden by a nearly 3-1 margin. But among people whose top concern was the economy — 28% of the electorate — Trump won an incredible <a title="" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/04/931308587/good-or-poor-pandemic-economy-splits-voters-along-partisan-lines" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/04/931308587/good-or-poor-pandemic-economy-splits-voters-along-partisan-lines" data-original-title="">80% of the vote</a>.</p>
<p>All of this points to a dramatic change. Trump may not have done much, politically, to deserve the support of Black, Latino, LGBTQ, and female voters. But the Democrats’ conspicuous refusal to address economic inequality and other class issues in a meaningful way created an opening….</p>
<p>Now, Trump is likely to leave the White House, but he created a coalition that some Republicans already understand would deliver massively in a non-pandemic situation. As Missouri Republican Josh Hawley put it the night of the election, “We are a working-class party now. That’s the future.”</p>

<p>What happens from here is a race to see which political party can make the obvious dumb move faster. Will the Democrats, emboldened by the false high of a Biden victory, blow off the clear need to revamp their economic messaging before 2022, when they risk losing both houses of congress?</p>
<p>Or will the Republican opposition give away the Trump coalition just as fast, by choosing Mitch McConnell’s donor list over Hawley’s insight?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Trump administration has a dirty little secret: It’s not just planning to increase taxes on most Americans. The increase has already been signed, sealed and delivered, buried in the pages of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.</p>
<p>President Trump and his congressional allies hoodwinked us. The law they passed initially<em> </em>lowered taxes for most Americans, but it built in automatic, stepped tax<em> </em>increases every two years that begin in 2021 and that by 2027 would affect nearly everyone but people at the top of the economic hierarchy. All taxpayer income groups with incomes of $75,000 and under — that’s about 65 percent of taxpayers — will face a higher tax rate in 2027 than in 2019….</p>
<p>By 2027, when the law’s provisions are set to be fully enacted, with the stealth tax increases complete, the country will be neatly divided into two groups: Those making over $100,000 will on average get a tax cut. Those earning under $100,000 — an income bracket encompassing three-quarters of taxpayers — will not.</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump has given his peers, people with annual incomes in excess of $1 million dollars, or the top 0.3 percent in the country, a huge gift: The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the average tax rate in 2019 for this group to be 2.3 percentage points lower than before the tax cut, saving the average taxpayer in this group over $64,000 — more than the average American family makes in a year.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“In the last several years, economists have learned about an antitrust problem of vast scope. Far from approximating the conditions of perfect competition as long assumed, most labor markets are characterized by monopsony—meaning that employers pay workers less than their productivity because workers lack a credible threat to quit and find a higherpaying job in the same market. Yet while antitrust law regulates labor monopsony in the same way as it regulates monopoly on the product market side, antitrust litigation against employers is rare. We document both the magnitude of labor monopsony and the paucity of cases and argue that this “litigation gap” exists because antitrust case law, which has developed through product-side litigation, is poorly tailored to labor-side problems.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And the proposals:</p>
<blockquote><p>We make four proposals. First, employees should be permitted to bring section 1 [“Parallelism”] claims against employers based on parallelism. Second, employees should be given more latitude to bring section 2 [“anticompetitive means”] claims against labor monopsonists. Third, the FTC and Justice Department should incorporate labormarket analysis into their review of mergers, and private claims by employees against merging firms should also be strengthened. Fourth, employers should not be permitted to foreclose antitrust class actions by including arbitration clauses in employment contracts.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Michael Bohmeyer’s website, “My Basic Income,” has given randomly selected people almost $1,200 a month for a year to see if it improves their lives. His answer: Yes.</p>
<p>….Enjoying life is no trivial matter for the slight, serious Mr. Bohmeyer, whose experimental, grass-roots platform has thus far given more than 650 randomly-selected people 1,000 euros a month, around $1,165, for a year, no strings attached, just to test a thesis. Namely, that what people need to thrive in a rapidly changing world is not more money, but more security, and that an unconditional basic income — a monthly sum to cover living expenses that, if implemented, would be paid by the government and received by everyone — could enable this.</p>
<p>The idea has resonated in Germany, a wealthy country that spends about a third of its G.D.P. on a robust social welfare system. In the six years since Mr. Bohmeyer first called for donations “My Basic Income” has raised about €8 million, thanks to 140,000 or so private donations of sums as low as a couple of euros a month.</p></blockquote>

<p class="">[ScienceDirect, via Naked Capitalism 11-7-20]</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Many studies have concluded that the current global economy can transition from fossil fuels to be powered entirely by renewable energy. While supporting such transition, we critique analysis purporting to conclusively demonstrate feasibility. Deep uncertainties remain about whether renewables can maintain, let alone grow, the range and scale of energy services presently provided by fossil fuels. The more optimistic renewable energy studies rely upon assumptions that may be theoretically or technically plausible, but which remain highly uncertain when real-world practicalities are accounted for. This places investigation of energy-society futures squarely in the domain of post-normal science, implying the need for greater ‘knowledge humility’ when framing and interpreting the findings from quantitative modelling exercises conducted to investigate energy futures. Greater appreciation for the limits of what we can know via such techniques reveals ‘energy descent’ as a plausible post-carbon scenario. Given the fundamental dependence of all economic activity on availability of energy in appropriate forms at sufficient rates, profound changes to dominant modes of production and consumption may be required, a view marginalised when more techno-optimistic futures are assumed.</p>

<p class="">The Republican Party—now committed to minoritarian rule, not democracy—needs fictions to sustain its power. And that means a collision with honest journalism&#8230;.</p>
<p class="">The Republican Party is increasingly a minority party, or counter-majoritarian, as some political scientists <a title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/opinion/republicans-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/opinion/republicans-trump.html" data-original-title="">put it</a>. The beliefs and priorities that hold it together are opposed by most Americans, who on a deeper level do not want to <em>be</em> what the GOP increasingly stands for. A counter-majoritarian party cannot present itself as such and win elections outside its dwindling strongholds. So it has to be counterfactual, too. It has to fight with fictions. Making it harder to vote, and harder to understand what the party is really about—these are two parts of the same project. The conflict with honest journalism is structural. To be its dwindling self, the GOP has to also be at war with the press, unless of course the press folds under pressure….</p>
<p class="">“Republican behavior in recent years suggests that they share the antebellum South’s determination to control the nation’s direction as a minority,” Brownstein writes. That’s why they went to such lengths to deny Obama a Supreme Court pick and sacrificed everything to get Amy Coney Barrett on the Court. “It’s evident in the flood of laws that Republican states have passed over the past decade making it more difficult to vote. And it’s evident in the fervent efforts from the party to restrict access to mail-in voting this year.” (Add to that list: <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/08/07/trumps-new-plan-to-hijack-the-census-will-imperil-americas-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/08/07/trumps-new-plan-to-hijack-the-census-will-imperil-americas-future/">interfering</a> with the census; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/trump-post-office-usps-election-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/trump-post-office-usps-election-funding">crippling</a> the Post Office.)….</p>

<p class="">Osita Nwanevu, November 6, 2020 [The New Republic ]</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Incidentally, issue polls, frequently derided as unreliable, are looking pretty good this week. Progressives have spent the last few years touting positive figures on support for marijuana legalization and a $15 minimum wage as evidence that their priorities, taken separately, are significantly <a title="" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160094/democrats-message-just-doesnt-matter" data-cke-saved-href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160094/democrats-message-just-doesnt-matter" data-original-title="">more popular than Democratic candidates</a>. On Tuesday night, marijuana legalization and a $15 minimum wage <em>significantly</em> outperformed Biden…</p>
<p class="">&#8230;the assumptions underpinning Democratic identity politics aren’t coming away from the campaign unscathed. The notion that minority representation and visibility and rhetoric about Trump’s bigotry would sweep not only Trump but Trumpism and the GOP away seems to have taken a real beating, particularly given, again, the gains Trump made among voters of color….</p>
<p class="">&#8230;To the extent that the pandemic was a major policy issue, voters likely went to the polls less with a real command of Biden’s plans on the coronavirus than with a general sense that he would manage the situation more capably and responsibly than Trump has. This is the dynamic Biden bet on from the outset—that voters in both the Democratic primary and the general election would be animated less by a policy agenda than by an urgent desire to put a seemingly good and sensible person in the White House.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ben Harris, policy director of the Hamilton Project, a neoliberal think tank within the centrist Brookings Institution that had been founded by Robert Rubin…. He took a job at Brookings working under William Gale, a Brookings fixture who had briefly served as an economist in George H. W. Bush’s administration. Their research focused primarily on taxes and budgets; their conclusions often warned of the nation’s unsustainable fiscal deficit while calling for tax increases, often on high earners….</p>
<p>By the end of 2014, unemployment had retreated from its Great Recession peak, but as the recovery unfolded, Biden had two chief concerns. One was stagnant wages—a side effect, Biden believed, of weakened worker power. Another had to do with a troubling corporate trend: Public companies that had received massive infusions of taxpayer funds at the dawn of the financial crisis were now using their earnings to buy back their stock, a strategy that improved share prices and passed that value onto investors, not workers…. When Biden weighed whether to enter the 2020 race, Harris was among a small group of former aides he consulted, and Biden brought Harris on as an informal economic adviser as soon as the campaign kicked off&#8230;.</p>
<p>Heather Boushey, the president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning economic think tank spun off from the Center for American Progress.</p>
<p>Boushey’s upbringing in the 1970s Seattle suburbs was an object lesson in the middle-class squeeze. Her father was a union machinist who built for Boeing; her mother worked as a bookkeeper to make ends’ meet. When Boeing laid off Boushey’s father in the early 1980s, her mother told her middle school-aged daughter that her swim team membership, $100 a month, might be on hold until her father resumed work.</p>
<p>….She joined Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign as one of its first informal policy advisers. Clinton’s first major economic address of the campaign—delivered at the New School, Boushey’s alma mater—touched on Boushey’s greatest hits: A decline in workforce participation among women, childcare, and paid family leave. Throughout the campaign, Boushey would raise her argument that equality and economic growth go hand in hand to defend Clinton against attacks from her opponent, Bernie Sanders, whose own run prized redistribution above all else…. As the 2020 race heated up, Boushey’s advice was consulted by nearly all of the candidates, but once the pandemic hit, her ideas became urgent. “There’s kind of two core ideas that have animated a lot of Heather’s work: One is about gender and the economy, and one is about inequality in the economy more broadly,” says Michael Linden, a founder of the Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning economic think tank. “Both of those are ridiculously relevant right now.”</p>
<p>….In the campaign’s final stretch, Harris has continued to work closely with Jake Sullivan on the development of economic-related policy. Boushey led an outside advisory group of hundreds of economists shaping how Biden might turn his campaign platform into executable policy. Bernstein has joined the transition’s advisory board. The economic briefings have continued, but on an ad-hoc, not daily, basis. On a campaign that’s been conducted largely over Zoom and email, it’s impossible to gauge what influence any one person is having<strong>, </strong>and that influence can vary from day-to-day. A broader group of regulars—including Austan Goolsbee, former Clinton and Obama NEC chair Gene Sperling, and AFL-CIO economist Bill Spriggs—also weigh in on policy details. Jeff Zients, another Obama NEC chair and a wealthy investor with deep business ties who now co-chair’s Biden’s transition team, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-economics-obama-stimulus-414869" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-economics-obama-stimulus-414869">also has</a> the candidate’s ear on economic matters. And, of course, there’s a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/12/19/biden-2020-campaign-president-advisers-087410" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/12/19/biden-2020-campaign-president-advisers-087410">tight-knit team</a> of longtime political advisers who touch every decision Biden makes….</p>
<p>Democrats have uniformly gotten over whatever sticker shock plagued the 2009 recovery—especially since Congress already passed $2.2 trillion in stimulus earlier this year. The deficit hawks have been relatively assuaged by the fact that interest rates—the key ingredient to making a bad debt worse—have remained low, and they accept the ongoing recession will only be remedied by a massive cash infusion. What a President Biden would hope to pass in January probably looks a lot like the $3 trillion program the House Democrats passed in June.</p>
<p>It’s what comes <em>after</em> this stimulus that might trigger a fight within the party, with friction between those in Biden’s ranks pushing for bolder policies and those more cautious about the political impacts.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Harold Myerson, November 5, 2020 [The American Prospect]<br />
As Democrats fail to take the Senate, their leader’s performance merits some scrutiny.</p>
<p>It’s the big picture that reveals Schumer’s failure. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent on his anointed Senate candidates in hopes of picking up the four seats required for a majority, the Democrats will likely end up picking up between three and none. And make no mistake: Schumer anointed virtually all of the party’s Senate hopefuls.</p>
<p>As Bob Moser <a title="" href="https://prospect.org/politics/power-to-the-person-chuck-schumer-democrat-senate-candidates/" data-cke-saved-href="https://prospect.org/politics/power-to-the-person-chuck-schumer-democrat-senate-candidates/" data-original-title="">detailed in our pages</a> in March, for many years now, Schumer has routinely selected a preferred Democratic candidate from a field of aspirants, funneling so much money to that candidate that opponents tend to drop out. Schumer’s choices are invariably centrists on the Democratic spectrum: Kansas’s Barbara Bollier, who lost by 12 points on Tuesday to Republican Roger Marshall, was until recently a Republican. M.J. Hegar, who fell by ten points to John Cornyn in Texas, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/mj-hegar-denies-royce-west-claim-shes-not-a-real-democrat-possibly-racist-hits-him-as-sexist-cozy-with-corruption/ar-BB16rKYL" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/mj-hegar-denies-royce-west-claim-shes-not-a-real-democrat-possibly-racist-hits-him-as-sexist-cozy-with-corruption/ar-BB16rKYL">voted in the Republican presidential primary</a> as recently as 2016….</p>
<p>&#8230;by handpicking candidates and driving their primary opponents from the field, he ensures that Democratic nominees aren’t really field-tested before they go up against Republican opponents. Schumer’s candidates all fit a milquetoast, don’t-make-waves stereotype that’s good for bossing them around inside the Senate Democratic caucus, but maybe not so much for inspiring people to vote. If you can discern any policy that this group actually ran on, let me know.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alexander Sammon, November 5, 2020 [The American Prospect]</p>
<blockquote><p>….on a night where Democrats were forecast to pick up as many as 20 seats in the chamber, not a single GOP incumbent has been defeated. The only two Democratic pickups thus far can be chalked up to court-mandated changes to congressional district maps in North Carolina….</p>
<p>That nightmarish result has Democrats pointing fingers as to who shoulders the blame. According to <u><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/04/dems-post-mortem-election-2020-434044" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/04/dems-post-mortem-election-2020-434044">Politico</a></u>, in a bold show of personal responsibility, “[s]everal centrist Democrats blamed their more progressive colleagues, saying moderates in Trump-leaning districts couldn’t escape their ‘socialist’ shadow.”</p>
<p>….The failures of Democratic leadership have been profound, running what should have been a Democratic advantage into the ground. But the leadership class who came up with and pursued that strategy is made up entirely of centrists, who have spurned progressives at every turn, claiming to know better, forcing them to watch quietly as senior-ranking moderates managed nothing in terms of legislation over the past two years and orchestrated a disastrous campaign strategy. That should be evidence enough that Pelosi, Bustos, and her centrist acolytes who managed to survive election night should be relieved of their leadership positions. Progressives, meanwhile, didn’t lose any members from their ranks and now make up a larger percentage of the caucus than ever, have the only credible claim to leadership positions, and should do everything in their power to take them over ahead of what will be much more challenging terrain in 2022.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Democrats were already engaging in rapid-fire finger-pointing about who is to blame for Tuesday’s embarrassing showing, with the private angst likely to spill out into the public in the coming days as the full House landscape becomes known. Several centrist Democrats blamed their more progressive colleagues, saying moderates in Trump-leaning districts couldn’t escape their “socialist” shadow.</p>
<p>Others argued that the DCCC had been far too bullish in seats the party was realistically never going to pick up — citing races such as Arkansas’ 2nd District — while missing the looming disaster in South Florida, where incumbents Shalala and Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell were ousted. Several Democrats said the party operation was not focused on a cohesive, proactive message that went beyond simply opposing Trump, who proved to remain popular in many districts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stephen Wolf for Daily Kos Elections, October 23, 2020</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been a cornerstone of American federalism for more than two centuries that when state courts make decisions based solely on state constitutional grounds that don&#8217;t conflict with federal law—as is the case here—those decisions are insulated from federal review. However, Republicans argue that the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s Elections Clause giving the &#8220;legislature&#8221; in each state the power to set the &#8220;times, places, and manner of holding&#8221; federal elections means that only the legislature itself may exercise that power, not those tasked with setting or interpreting state laws, such as state courts.</p>
<p>In other words, Republicans are arguing that state courts—as well as voter-initiated ballot measures and potentially even governors—lack the power to set election laws when they disagree with the legislature. Such a notion would shatter the principle of judicial review at the state level. In a state such as Pennsylvania, where the GOP holds gerrymandered legislative majorities despite Democrats winning more votes in 2018, it would cement minority rule by removing any real check on ill-gained legislative power. This outcome would eliminate any real recourse that voters have to end gerrymandering when lawmakers won&#8217;t act.</p>
<p>The last few months have seen the U.S. Supreme Court and federal judges appointed by Republicans repeatedly rule against voting rights. This Pennsylvania case is an ominous indicator that right-wing judges will go to new extremes to eviscerate voting protections to entrench the GOP in power for the foreseeable future. Should Democrats overcome these barriers next month and win the presidency and Senate, they will likely soon face the difficult choice of either reforming the structure of the courts or watch voting rights wither away under an unrelenting judicial assault.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>….Obama’s Flint speech went further. Echoing a previous refrain from <a title="" href="https://twitter.com/michaelbennet/status/1158806845953323008?lang=en" data-cke-saved-href="https://twitter.com/michaelbennet/status/1158806845953323008?lang=en" data-original-title="">Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet</a>, it was a call to resurrect Brunch Liberalism whereby large swaths of the American left disengage and defer in much the same way it did during the Obama administration, to disastrous effect.</p>
<p>Though it is now forgotten history, the history <em>is</em> clear: After years of mass protest and activism against the George W. Bush administration, many liberal activists, voters and advocacy groups went to brunch after the 2008 election, fell in line and refused to pressure the new administration to do much of anything. Those that dared to speak out were often <a title="" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703808904575025030384695158" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703808904575025030384695158" data-original-title="">berated</a> and <a title="" href="https://durangoherald.com/articles/9964" data-cke-saved-href="https://durangoherald.com/articles/9964" data-original-title="">shamed</a>….</p>
<p>But disengagement won’t be fine for the rest of us. As Rep.

<p>AOC is right to sound that alarm, because going back to brunch could create the atmosphere for a new administration that brushes off calls for bold action on health care, climate change, wages, union rights and corporate regulation. Worse, it could let the new president follow through on his promises to donors that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/biden-tells-elite-donors-he-doesn-t-want-to-demonize-the-rich" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/biden-tells-elite-donors-he-doesn-t-want-to-demonize-the-rich">nothing would fundamentally change</a> and that there is <a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/p/biden-just-made-a-big-promise-to" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyposter.com/p/biden-just-made-a-big-promise-to">no forthcoming legislation</a> to change corporate behavior.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Trump won 81 percent of the vote among the third of the electorate that listed the economy as its top priority. Even more amazing — Trump and Biden equally split the vote among those whose priority is a president who ‘cares about people like me.&#8217;” Also: “Democrats raised roughly a quarter billion dollars for senate races in Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas and Alabama — and their candidates all appear to have gone down to defeat by 10 points or more.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="">[The American Prospect 11-6-2020]</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">No, says Harvard law professor Michael Klarman, who spoke with Prospect co-editor Robert Kuttner….</p>
<p><strong>….If the Democrats were to take back control of the Senate in 2022, what would democratic re-entrenchment measures look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MK:</strong> Democratic legislatures should make voter registration and voting easier. Registration can be made automatic for all citizens when they turn 18 and for older citizens when they interact with government agencies. Same-day voter registration significantly enhances turnout without increasing fraud, contrary to the baseless charges of Republicans. Felon disfranchisement, which has enormous racially disparate effects, should be ended. Election Day should be made a holiday. Gubernatorial elections should take place at the same time as presidential elections, when voter turnout is much higher and is more demographically representative.</p>
<p>The number of early-voting days, polling places, and voting machines should be increased, so people need not wait in long lines to vote. Absentee ballots should be available without excuse. Onerous identification requirements should be eliminated because they reduce turnout on the pretext of reducing fraud. Partisan gerrymandering should be ended. Public financing of elections would help reduce the influence of money in politics until the Court’s atrocious campaign finance decisions are overturned.</p>
<p>Such measures would go a decent way toward making the American political system more representative of the American people. However, there is a significant chance that the most conservative Supreme Court in a century would invalidate all or many of these measures, at least insofar as they purport to regulate <em>state</em> elections, on federalism grounds.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It was the Republican State Legislature in Pennsylvania that earlier this year refused the request by counties to be allowed, because of the pandemic, to begin counting the mailed-in ballots prior to election day. As of this morning, more than 1.4 million, timely received, mailed-in ballots remain to be counted in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that mailed-in ballots that are postmarked before or by election day can be received in the mail up to three days later and still be counted, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania sought to overturn that decision at the U.S. Supreme Court.

<blockquote><p>The US COVID-19 crisis fits the pattern of President Donald Trump’s career with its serial bankruptcies.

<p>Jedediah Britton-Purdy  [Dissent, via Naked Capitalism Water Cooler 11-6-20]</p>
<p><em>Britton-Purdy is a professor at Columbia University Law School since 2019. Previously, he taught at Duke Law School 15 years. He teaches and writes about environmental, property, and constitutional law as well as legal and political theory. He is a regular contributor to </em>Jacobin, Dissent, <em>and on the editorial board of </em>The American Prospect<em>.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>“[I]t is essential to orient radical politics toward a possible majority, and that if we are not doing that, in this country, we are doing something other than politics.”</p>
<p>The past decade has brought the greatest revival of left energies in half a century, if not longer. The past year has also seen the rout of the left in the Democratic presidential primaries, ensuring a near-term future of dissent and supplication more than ruling. This situation makes the choices of the next years particularly important. Will they point toward accepting a marginal, gadfly role, with power in a few city governments (which are, sadly, mostly not very powerful themselves) and a visionary flank of legislators who rarely control key votes? Or will they continue to press toward the goal, not just of the Bernie Sanders campaign itself, but of the activists and energies that gathered around it: to build a majority that can wield power?</p>
<p>….Pursuing majorities is especially frustrating in the United States because antidemocratic features of the political system make a political majority sharply different from a demographic or even electoral majority. The Electoral College, the Senate, gerrymandering, and disenfranchisement all stanch majorities, while the Supreme Court can thwart them even when they become effective. I’ve argued elsewhere that a democratic agenda in the United States should include constitutional reform and full enfranchisement for everyone who makes their lives here. <strong>But in any version, to get there, we have to go through the institutions we have.</strong> Political power is a thoroughly artificial thing, and votes are where you get it if you are not the financial industry, a retail empire, or big oil. (We are not.)</p>
<p>There are many perfectly good ways of thinking about politics, or practicing ethics, or pursuing institutional influence, that do not involve trying to bring a political majority into being to exercise power. Many of these might be corrupted, or at least confused, by a democratic political orientation. That last orientation, however, has to be primary when we are doing politics in a quasi-democratic polity like the United States. If we cannot explain how<em> </em>we are going after that majority, we should entertain the possibility that we are not engaged in democratic politics at all….</p>
<p>Billy Bragg, a product of the final years of anti-Thatcher laborism who survived as a movement poet without a movement, was by then singing about “a socialism of the heart.” He echoed Czech president Václav Havel, a dissident playwright imprisoned under communism, who wrote, “Though my heart may be left of center, I have always known that the only economic system that works is a market economy.” Figures like Havel had resisted authoritarian regimes that most observers expected to last through their lives and longer. Almost necessarily, they had worked without a plan beyond what Havel called “living in truth”—being, like punks and some pop stars, against lies and violence, although at greater personal risk and expecting no definite reward. Their quixotic persistence and unexpected victory seemed testament to a magical version of politics: the world’s powers really might bend, or break, before the speaking of truth. Pronounce the right words, and the walls would fall.…</p>
<p>Samuel Moyn has aptly called “the last utopia”: With socialism seemingly ruled out, the minimalist liberty of human rights—the negative protection of every person from state abuse—was the only radicalism that still seemed viable. Human rights embodied the same ethical-cum-aesthetic politics as the dissident playwrights and punk radicals. It was about the truth one spoke to power….</p>
<p>&#8230;If there was no political critique of capitalism, just a socialism of the heart, then there was, really, no truth to speak against the market’s decentralized and quasi-voluntary forms of power. Markets were just there, a morally neutral form of power, an implicit truth. The American conceit of that time was that the rest of humanity was waiting to become us, to shake off the accretions and abuses of history and become just people, unmodified—like us, but maybe with different outfits or spices. And such people would, beyond doubt, live in a marketplace, as pervasive and invisible as the air. They would also live in plenitude. The American supermarket was the cornucopia at the end of history, the promise of abundance that supposedly had pulled the East inexorably across the borders to the West. It was, maybe, the other last utopia, the promise of scarcity’s end&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>9-11, war</em></p>
<p>Besides war, the world was to be saved from Hillary Clinton’s consultant-heavy politics, a reprise of her husband’s “triangulation” toward post-partisanship between 1992 and 2000, premised on the certainty that winning elections was a game with definite, fixed rules, which an expert could master. Obama’s campaign renewed a different feeling: that mobilized people could remake the rules, even become—sometimes, to some degree—different people through politics. We were, he said in effect, more, better, something else than this country we found ourselves in; and, in a bit of imaginative alchemy, we who carried this unrealized possibility in ourselves also <em>we</em><em>re</em> America. “We are the ones we have been waiting for,” he assured us (cribbing from Alice Walker)—a brilliant phrase of imprecise political meaning but exact emotional aim.</p>
<p>Treading the back roads of South Carolina for Obama in the days before he dominated in its primary, it really did feel as if the campaign had rediscovered something buried for decades: that an election could be the arena for a movement, and that in a movement citizens could face one another and ask what kind of country they wanted to share….</p>
<p>In hindsight, the first Obama campaign had the spirit, the feeling, of democratic transformation without the substance of a transformative program or a strategy for building power beyond winning the presidential election. In those ways it was another magical politics, one too keyed to the incantations of its charismatic cynosure. It was, by the same token, too inattentive to the loss of majorities in state legislatures, the Republican gerrymandering that followed after 2010, and the retreat of the Democratic electorate to the cities and some suburbs. In power, Obama, an institutionalist and small-c conservative by nature, drew toward the technocratic authority of generals, bankers, and economists, along with hardball political fixers of the Rahm Emanuel variety. Reports from people who dealt closely with his administration describe a pervasive contempt for idealists and “the left,” an attitude emanating from the president, who regarded himself as a thoroughgoing realist. It may be that the only thing Obama shares with his successor in the White House is contempt for those who are too easily gratified by his spiel.</p>
<p>But the political energy that Obama had conjured took new forms at the margins of power. As Obama pulled rhetorically toward an American center that sometimes only he seemed able to see, new movements announced a sense of crisis and possibility. In different registers, Occupy Wall Street, North Carolina’s Moral Mondays movement (now the national Poor People’s Campaign), and Black Lives Matter all insisted that conditions were very bad for distinct, but overlapping, reasons: oligarchy (Occupy), a far-right takeover of a divided state’s government (Moral Mondays), and police killings (Black Lives Matter). Such movements always arise from many causes and years of uncelebrated organizing, but they had in common a radical hope placed in politics. Starting from the premise that things were worse in the country than Obama allowed, they all asked more of it than he permitted himself to do….</p>
<p>Obama’s first campaign, like Trump’s, was a movement that promised to reclaim America. It, too, produced a government that could not contain or channel the energies that had brought it there. From the best of us to the worst, no one knows what to do with these irruptions of remake-the-country energy, but it is hard to succeed without them. What defeated Hillary Clinton, besides the misogyny and anti-Obama animus that Trump rallied, was her deafness to that political music—the same that Obama had used to stop her in 2008—and palpable desire to pass through the formalities of election to the business of administration. By turns high-minded and brutish, the last two presidencies, these American opposites, are aspects of a revival of political energies that is irrepressible but inchoate. It is the most dangerous and the most hopeful thing….</p>
<p>There is a caesura in the new millennium between people who adopted Obama as a charismatic near-prophet and, even disenchanted from that dream, still see him as embodying the country’s best possibilities, and those, a little younger, for whom he was always the voice of a comfortable adult world that had no idea how bad things had become. The younger group might like and even admire him, but they do not expect him, or his epigones, to set things right….</p>
<p>Although stories about how “the internet changed everything” are such truisms that one instinctively doubts them, I have trouble imagining the movements of the Obama years emerging as they did without it. Dissent was no longer isolating….</p>
<p>Occupy has been distilled in memory to the slogan “We are the 99 percent.”</p>
<p>….The 2016 Sanders campaign did more for social democratic politics than any other effort or event in this country for at least fifty years, and more likely for something closer to a century. It did so in a political landscape that, in 2015, presented no obvious social base for such a politics. No long game of labor or left organizing supported an electoral strategy far to the left of the Democratic mainstream. Hence Sanders’s campaign began as a classic protest run, with hardly a thought of upending Clinton’s richly bolstered expectation of the nomination. The movement that gathered around him would not have taken the form it did without his candidacy, but in many ways it took Sanders as its occasion, rather than his conjuring it. The underappreciated leading indicator in 2016 was that Sanders, a politically marginal maverick from a small state, was among the most-followed politicians on social media. His clarity and forcefulness on economic inequality and political oligarchy made him a gathering point for a new climate of opinion that was emerging from mutual affirmations of radicalism….</p>
<p>The left will need, too, to work out relations—not necessarily <em>one</em> relationship—between its internationalist disposition and the fight for national majorities that is, and is likely to remain for our lifetimes, the main arena of constructive politics. Those majorities, and their states, are the actual agents of any fundamental transformation. No such agents exist for a democratic, egalitarian politics on an international scale. A left politics that rejects national sentiment as such, or refuses on principle the idea that a state should often put its own people’s welfare first, will cut itself off from the workings of politics. There are perfectly respectable reasons to advocate a more radical internationalism, but such advocacy tends to be a retreat from politics here and now, back toward the more testimonial moralism of “truth to power.”</p></blockquote>

				<p>What, the party that squashed relief for the millions of Americans in distress due to the CoVID pandemic just because &#8220;lookie, the stock market is doing great!&#8221; (because unlike the plebes, they DID get massive bailouts) is now the &#8216;working class  party?&#8221;  *Please*.</p>
<p>What you probably saw in the upsurge in minority Trump votes are class differences, cutting across racial/ethic/sexual preference lines, and not a working class embrace of Trumpism.   And the embrace is pretty small, in most instances it&#8217;s still at 3:1 or 4:1 or more disadvantage to the Trumpists.  Here&#8217;s a hint: as you said, the people who thought &#8220;the economy is doing great!!&#8221; voted overwhelmingly for Trump.  However, the real economy was pretty shitty even before CoVID (the same as Obama&#8217;s second term) for ordinary people and absolutely cratered during CoVID, while the fortunes of the upper crust climbed higher.  I think that answers the question of &#8220;who&#8211;despite racial, ethnic, or sexual preference-thinks the Trump economy is &#8216;great&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

				<p>I will update my last comment is that I do believe that there is one group of working-class people that might think that despite the evidence to the contrary, Trumpism was great economics.  They&#8217;re working class white men.  But these have been voting against their economic self-interest for at least fifty years; and yes, they started doing so well before the Democrats went corporatist, and they did so largely due to &#8216;identity politics&#8217;.   So if you want to rage against &#8216;identity politics&#8217;, that&#8217;s a good place to start.</p>

				<p>Maybe Biden&#8217;s opus in Foreign Affairs should be linked here so that we can hear from the man himself what he intends to do.</p>
<p>It is back to the future.</p>

<p>-He has launched ill-advised trade wars, against the United States’ friends and foes alike, that are hurting the American middle class. &#8211;</p>
<p>-set our annual refugee admissions at 125,000, and seek to raise it over time- </p>
<p>-The most effective way to meet that challenge is to build a united front of U.S. allies and partners to confront China’s abusive behaviors and human rights violations, even as we seek to cooperate with Beijing on issues where our interests converge, such as climate change, nonproliferation, and global health security. &#8211; </p>
<p>-we should bring the vast majority of our troops home from the wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East and narrowly define our mission as defeating al Qaeda and the Islamic State (or ISIS). We should also end our support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.-</p>

				<blockquote><p>There is no working class party in the US. Even more, there isn’t a party which represents the lower 80% of the population.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not yet. The Republican Party isn&#8217;t a working class party by any stretch of the imagination, and the Democratic Party doesn&#8217;t want to be one &#8212; would prefer to be nice polite Republicans, which soon they will be.</p>
<p>Republicans pretend, though, and they sometimes deliver to some of the plebes what will sooth their anxieties. Dems don&#8217;t. Dems won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Question: what constitutes the Working Class? Anyone who works for wages? Or ? We really need to be clear about this, because the way US narratives are conceived, there is no working class or upper class, all is middle class, &#8220;Hard Working&#8221; at that. And we know that&#8217;s not true, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>So what constitutes the working class?</p>

				<p>There won&#8217;t be a working class or lower class party in America as long as most Americans accept the teaching they received that working classness or lower classness is embarrassing and shameful.</p>
<p>     The only way for the ClassShamed American to get over their ClassShame is to break through it or work through it on their own.    Maybe helping eachother in sets and groups.    But no help will come from the ClassProud Middles and Uppers.</p>
<p>      And the Working Class will have to get over its fear and loathing and self-defensive contempt for the Lower Classes.    They will have to learn for themselves that hating and despising the Lower Classes will not save them from being demoted into the Lower Classes whenever the ClassProud Middles and/or Uppers feel like demoting them.</p>
<p>     If the Working Classes ever understand themselves to be temporarily-better-off Lower Class people, then they will have made some initial progress towards understanding their position and situation.</p>
<p>    Perhaps a wannabe-party can help in that process by planting the right brain-mines in the right ways in the right places.</p>
<p>    Such a wannabe-party could call itself the Lower Class Majority Party.    Because the Majority is Lower Class.    And if a majority of the lower class majority decide to face and accept that basic fact about their position in society, then they will no longer be too embarrassed to be seen having a membership card in such a Socially-Immobile-And-Proud organization as a Lower Class Majority Party.</p>
<p>     And if the majority of the majority decides to understand themselves in that reality-based way, then they can join the Lower Class Majority Party and turn it INto THE majority party in America.    And then use it as a weapons system to get what they want from a hostile Class Enemy System.</p>

<p>Two Lawyers go over election law, the Constitution, Benford&#8217;s Law, and how this will likely go down. Trump is most likely to succeed in proving fraud and getting Mail Ballots tossed and flipping WI, MI, PA, GE, NV, AZ, and possibly even VA. Either way the stage is set for a gigantic reckoning.</p>

				<p>I like a definition of working class I once ran across.   If you are subject to physical injury or sickness or disability beCAUSE of the work you do, you are working class.</p>
<p>    If that definition is considered a good one, then I am in the working class and I have the residual after-effects of tendinits, de Cuervane&#8217;s area syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome , chronic chondromalacia of the knees to prove it.</p>

				<p>Given NL&#8217;s definition of working class, you might be hard put to show that most Trump voters/Republican voters are working class. At least from my perspective, Trump&#8217;s fans and most Rs are petit bourgeois, workers, yes, yet generally independent of an employer but beholden to banks and other lenders, and serving wealth and power to survive.</p>
<p>Most Dems on the other hand are working class, but dominated by those better off at the upper levels &#8212; which usually isn&#8217;t wise. </p>
<p>Independent contractors &#8212; unless at the top of their field &#8212; are often worse off than petit bourgeois, but they&#8217;re awash with freedom, right?</p>
<p>Academics and the professional classes are are even more complicated, usually fitting NL&#8217;s definition of working class, yet believing and acting as if they were anything but. </p>
<p>Both parties represent parts of the upper levels of the working class. Sometimes.</p>
<p>But mostly, both parties represent the interests of wealth and power, usually to the detriment of everyone else.</p>

				<p>As of 2018, there are 30.2 million small businesses operating in the United States. (Source: <a href="https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/small-business-statistics/" rel="nofollow">https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/small-business-statistics/</a>)</p>
<p>22 million of the small businesses in the United States are individually operated, meaning that they have no other employees other than the owner. (Source: <a href="https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/small-business-statistics/" rel="nofollow">https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/small-business-statistics/</a>)</p>
<p>Those who work independently still sell their bodies and minds. So, I would not count them as businesses.<br />
30.2-22=8.2 These 8.2 are buyers of bodies and minds. Many are probably in CA and NY.  I am guessing there is not enough petit bourgeois to support Trump, but I would be interested in seeing % distribution of these people between the two camps. These 8.2 + 22 are probably mostly in serves, the same services that COVID-19 is wiping out. Trump&#8217;s calls to keep &#8216;economy open&#8217; played to that constituency.</p>

				<p>Everybody wants a sense of worth.  In the U.S. that&#8217;s always meant getting the trappings of achievement, from more money to a higher status job.  The ptb have defined job status in a way that keeps higher paid jobs to themselves &#8212; jobs that require credentials from elite, expensive institutions.  We must break out of this hierarchical categorizing of people.  Somebody&#8217;s got to pick tomatoes and collect garbage.  Covid-19 has shown who the essential workers really are.  It makes clear how vicious a message is that says, &#8220;You want a better life, get a better job.&#8221;  Let&#8217;s instead remember Debs who said &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to rise from the masses;  I want to rise with the masses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s quit assigning value to people based on a work hierarchy.  The tomato picker and the garbage collector should make enough money to participate fully in the society, just as each of us should.  Who&#8217;s in the working class is an interesting question for analysis, but it shouldn&#8217;t be considered a real issue in developing decent politics.</p>

				<p>Ever since the Democrats decided to jettison their old coalition (organized labor, racial minorities, etc.) and go after the professional class, the working class has not had a party that served their interests. Workers still voted, of course, but there were no issues on any platform to improve the lot of the working class. So, appeals to their patriotism, their racial bias, their disdain for immigrants (legal and otherwise), etc. were made but no representation on the issue of working people.</p>
<p>So, the question: which party is the party of the working class is simple: neither.</p>

				<p>Jay Rosen writing in the New York Review of Books seems to be in a Media echo chamber of his own. He thinks the Republican Party is fading away. As if. And, apparently the Republicans alone are running on &#8220;fictions&#8221; &#8212; apparently Rosen never noticed Russiagate.</p>

				<p>@Ten Bears,</p>
<p>      Do you mock my pain, Sir?</p>
<p>       Trigger Thumbs is a thing.   It is a subset in particular of Trigger Finger in general.   I can describe it if you wish.    Or otherwise it can be search-engined.    I feel confident that there is an entry for it.</p>

				<p>Took me one gatekeeper, and a hand specialist two cortisone shots to &#8216;cure&#8217; my trigger thumb. </p>
<p>I usually ride out pain with some rest-n-rehab researched myself, but it was getting too much to get the thumb moving in the morning.  So glad I was insured at the time, and lucky to get a qualified and ethical specialist.  </p>
<p>Not so lucky with an ear infection, which had been misdiagnosed the first time by an idiotic fake doctor (nurse practitioner) when my own guy (big city clinic) was a month out.  I trusted their recommendation, never again.  She charged the same.  I then had to go in six times to an ENT who wanted the extra business.  That place wound up with major malpractice lawsuits after a fake &#8216;all-star surgeon&#8217; scandal.  It remember when it was once top-notch.</p>
<p>We have no choice but to have the government get involved when medical MBAs and lobbyists ruin the business.</p>
